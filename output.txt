With Recursive:
	Matrix:
	[2, 3, 8, 3, 6]
	[7, 4, 8, 3, 3]
	[3, 1, 7, 5, 2]
	[3, 2, 7, 8, 7]
	[8, 9, 2, 7, 9]
	Determinant: 3110.0
	Delta time (ms): 3.2486

With Gaussian:
	Matrix:
	[2, 3, 8, 3, 6]
	[7, 4, 8, 3, 3]
	[3, 1, 7, 5, 2]
	[3, 2, 7, 8, 7]
	[8, 9, 2, 7, 9]
	Determinant: 3110.0000000000005
	Delta time (ms): 0.359

With LU:
	Matrix:
	[2, 3, 8, 3, 6]
	[7, 4, 8, 3, 3]
	[3, 1, 7, 5, 2]
	[3, 2, 7, 8, 7]
	[8, 9, 2, 7, 9]
	Determinant: 3110.0
	Delta time (ms): 0.4696

Compare: 
	Gaussian's time = 0.359  is faster than  Recursive's time = 3.2486
